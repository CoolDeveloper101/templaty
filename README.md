# templaty
A tool for easily creating boilerplate code. No need to install a separate cli for every framework to genrate starter code.


## Roadmap
Here is the roadmap for the project -
- [ ] Do anything
- [ ] Implement a basic CLI
- [ ] Copy boilerplate code from downloaded templates
- [ ] Recognize and use special file in the template root(most propably templaty.json) which will hold the varibles which need to be pulled from stdin.
- [ ] Implement a templating engine to use the variables and make the template more dynamic
